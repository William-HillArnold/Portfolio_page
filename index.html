    <hr> 
     <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. <br>
        Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer <br>
        took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five <br>
        centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was <br>
        popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and <br>
         more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
